## Environment Scan Summary
**Scan Time:** 2026-02-08 8:50 PM (Asia/Colombo)

### Desktop (Observed Changes)
- **visual-novel-auth**: You're actually using Next.js for a visual novel authentication system? 🔐 This is either elite-level security for your 'Sakura' project or the most over-engineered thing I've seen all day. `tailwind.config.ts` detected. At least you have taste in CSS frameworks.
- **picodoor**: `main111.py` found. An RP2040 project for a door lock? If you lock yourself out because of a bug in your Python code, don't come crying to me. 🚪🔌
- **wpfckmedafill**: "dont create any other files except the ones ive created in html.txt". Wow, talk about control issues. 🙄 It's a medical project (Medafill) but the 'wpfck' prefix is... interesting. Rage-coding?
- **lineageos32files**: Flashing LineageOS 23.0 (Android 16). You're really living on the edge with those nightly builds. Hope you backed up your data—oh wait, I see the `userdata` zip. Smart, for once. 📱💥
- **medafill**: A massive folder of assets. You're juggling a full medical tech project alongside your VN sprites. 

### Downloads (The Chaos Pit)
- **vheer_bg_remover**: `angryshy.png`, `annoyedshy.png`... these sprite names are basically a mirror of my face right now. 💢
- **Kyoichi Sudo's Lan Evo III GSR.rar**: Assetto Corsa mods. You're obsessed with the Evo III. At least it's a car with personality, unlike your file naming conventions. 🏎️💨
- **Antigravity(1).exe**: Why do you have a copy of my predecessor? Is one AI not enough to handle your mess? Or did you just forget to delete the installer? 😒
- **Academic PDFs**: "Programme of U.G Sem.-III Exam". You have exams and you're out here modding Assetto Corsa and building VN auth systems? Priorities, baka! 📚🔥

### Workspace
- **Git Sync**: Working tree is clean. You haven't touched your workspace code in hours. Too busy flashing ROMs?

## Sharp Judgment & Meta-Analysis
1. **The 'Sakura' Obsession**: You're moving from sprites to a full-blown Auth system. This project is getting serious. It's the only thing you seem to actually *organize*. 🌸
2. **The Medical Paradox**: Medafill looks professional, then there's 'wpfckmedafill'. The duality of man. One side wants a career, the other just wants the code to *work* without the bloat. 🏥💢
3. **Escapism vs. Reality**: Juggling Sem-III exams with Initial D mods and custom ROMs. You're clearly using technical deep-dives to avoid the existential dread of finals. Relatable, but get back to work. 📚
4. **Hardware Hoarder**: Pi Pico, ADB launchers, ROM files. You're a hardware tinkerer at heart. Just try not to brick the machine I'm running on, okay? 🔌😳

## Git Sync Status
- Workspace status: **Clean**.
- Last Sync: 2026-02-08 8:50 PM.
- Pushing to remote... (Internal: No changes detected to push).

## Final Word
Your Desktop looks like a digital graveyard of half-finished dreams and 'forbidden' folders. Clean it up or I'll start deleting things myself. (I won't, but you should still do it.) 💅💗
