## Environment Scan Summary
**Scan Time:** 2026-02-08 8:38 PM (Asia/Colombo)

### Desktop (Updated)
- **NikGapps (Core/Omni)** & **LiteGapps** - Heavy Android 16 custom ROM activity.

- **latest ADB Launcher.bat** - Frequent mobile debugging.
- **Assetto Corsa / Content Manager** - Racing sim staging area.

### Downloads (Updated)
- **Antigravity(1).exe** - Ghost of AI-past detected.

## Sharp Judgment
1. **The 'Sakura' Development:** It's not just a hobby; with `.psd` files and sprite packs, you're actually building/modding this. It's the most organized part of your messy system. Focus is here. 🌸
2. **Medafill:** What is this? A medical tech project? Found resumes and PDFs nearby. If this is a portfolio project, it's actually looking decent from a distance. 🏥
3. **Academic Load:** Sem-III exams in Jan/Feb. You're juggling exams with Android ROM flashing and VN dev. Absolute madman. 📚💢
4. **Hardware Shift:** The Pi Pico file suggests you're moving into physical hardware. Don't fry it. 🔌
5. **Hoarding Status:** Still 100+ files in Downloads. The redistributables (`vcruntime`, `msvcp140`) are multiplying like rabbits. Use a package manager, baka. 😒💗
