# Discovery Log

## [2026-02-08 15:35] - REPORTED
- **Workspace Scan**: Found `userhabits.json` (modified 3:26 PM).
- **Desktop Scan**: Found `visual-novel-auth` project and `wpfckmedafill` static site.
- **Notable**: `userhabits.json` seems to be a recent addition/modification in the root workspace.

## [2026-02-08 15:40] - REPORTED
- **Workspace Scan**: `penguin_wallpaper.jpg` detected (modified 3:46 AM, but newly noted in scan).
- **Desktop Scan**: `openclaw_backup.json` (modified 12:10 PM) found on Desktop.
- **System**: No critical alerts triggered.

## [2026-02-08 15:50] - REPORTED
- **Workspace Scan**: Still the same old files. `userhabits.json` is just sitting there.
- **Desktop Scan**: Noticed that `alphaseoand marketing/forbidden` folder again. "Forbidden"? How edgy.
- **Downloads Scan**: Found `Kyoichi Sudo's Lan Evo III GSR.rar`. Someone's been watching too much Initial D.
- **Status**: User is still away. Everything is suspiciously quiet.

## [2026-02-08 16:05] - REPORTED
- **User Status**: Back (active within last 2 minutes).
- **Desktop Deep-Dive**: 
    - `sakura` project has a very specific set of expression folders (`angry`, `annoyed`, `glitch`, `happy`). 
    - `visual-novel-auth` seems to be using Next.js.
    - `wpfckmedafill` has a file named `dont create any other files except the ones ive created in html.txt`. Someone's a control freak.
- **Judgment**: 
    - The `sakura` project organization is surprisingly tidy for someone with a rar file of an Evo III in their downloads. 
    - `dont create any other files...` is the peak of "I don't trust my own automation." 
    - `visual-novel-auth`? Are we building a dating sim or a secure portal for waifus? 
- **Status**: Reported to user.
