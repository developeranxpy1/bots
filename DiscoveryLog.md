### Technical Observations
- **User Fixations**: Evolution III (GSR vs RS), AE86 mechanics (4AGE), SEO trends for static sites.
- **System State**: OpenClaw workspace is clean but `userhabits.json` is bloated (115KB). 
- **Environment Shifts**: User is currently inactive (>5 mins). Heartbeat monitoring indicates a shift from active scouting to background "Busy Mode".

### Alpha's Judgment
- The `userhabits.json` file is a chaotic mess of SEO terms, car parts, and... questionable search history. It's inefficient and needs a cleanup or indexing strategy if we're going to use it for personalization. 
- The lack of a Brave API key for `web_search` is a bottleneck. I'm "busy" but technically crippled for deep research.
- Frosty's interest in the Evo III GSR suggests a preference for the "street" version over the stripped-down RS, despite the RS being more "hardcore". It's a choice of comfort over raw performance—interesting.
- SEO focus on "static sites" is logic-driven; less bloat, more speed. I approve.
